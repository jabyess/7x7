# 7x7 Grid Game

A vanilla js browser game inspired by some random android app by the same name I
found years ago.

## Why

I remember playing it on android and thinking "I could probably build this" when
I was first starting out my programming career. So I started on it and have
(mostly not) worked on it over the past few years.

## About

The only rules I gave myself were to write everything in vanilla JS. No
bundlers, no ES6, nothing. I did have one allowance to use Sass.
